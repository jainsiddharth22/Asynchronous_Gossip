Import the whole project in visual studio and run the program.fs file with arguments also passed from visual studio

## Details
Gossip type algorithms can be used both for group communication and for aggregate computation. The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of such algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in F#

**Gossip Algorithm for information propagation**
The Gossip algorithm
involves the following:
- **Starting:** A participant(actor) it told/sent a roumor(fact) by the main
process
- **Step:** Each actor selects a random neighbor and tells it the rumor
- **Termination:** Each actor keeps track of rumors and how many times it
has heard the rumor. It stops transmitting once it has heard the rumor
10 times (10 is arbitrary, you can select other values).

**Push-Sum algorithm for sum computation**
- **State:** Each actor Ai maintains two quantities: s and w. Initially, s =
x<sub>i</sub> = i (that is actor number i has value i, play with other distribution if
you so desire) and w = 1
- **Starting:** Ask one of the actors to start from the main process.
- **Receive:** Messages sent and received are pairs of the form (s, w). Upon
receive, an actor should add received pair to its own corresponding values. Upon receive, each actor selects a random neighboor and sends it a
message.
- **Send:** When sending a message to another actor, half of s and w is kept
by the sending actor and half is placed in the message.
- **Sum estimate:** At any given moment of time, the sum estimate is s
w
where s and w are the current values of an actor.
- **Termination:** If an actors ratio s/w
did not change more than 10<sup>âˆ’10</sup> in
3 consecutive rounds the actor terminates. **WARNING: the values s
and w independently never converge, only the ratio does.**

**Topologies** The actual network topology plays a critical role in the dissemination speed of Gossip protocols. As part of this project you have to experiment
with various topologies. The topology determines who is considered a neighboor
in the above algorithms.
- **Full Network:** Every actor is a neighbor of all other actors. That is, every
actor can talk directly to any other actor.
- **2D Grid:** Actors form a 2D grid. The actors can only talk to the grid
neighbors.
- **Line:** Actors are arranged in a line. Each actor has only 2 neighbors (one
left and one right, unless you are the first or last actor).
- **Imperfect 2D Grid:** Grid arrangement but one random other neighbor
is selected from the list of all actors (4+1 neighbors).
